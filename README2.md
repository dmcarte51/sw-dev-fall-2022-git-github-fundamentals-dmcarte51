# I learned how to navigate Git Bash/Kraken and GitHub for the basics such as committing, pull requests, and forking a repo. I also learned about creating files and documents in the CLI. 

I did have some trouble with some of the commands in GitKraken which forced me to go back to Git Bash. I'm still going to mess with Kraken because it seems very useful but Bash might have to be my main CLI.
